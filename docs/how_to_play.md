### How to play the game

When the page is finished loading you will need to log inn or sign up.
Once you have done this you will be thrown into a lobby. If you are the first one to enter the lobby you will also see a button 
wich lets you start the game. 

There is no requirement tpo how many that can join the game. When someone joins the game their name
wil show up on the screen.

When the admin decide to start the game, a timer will start to count down and everyone will be presented with a question
and 2-4 answer choices. Score is determined by how fast one answer.

When the time is up a new  question will appear, and the score will be updated. This will rinse 
and repeat until all rounds have been played, at which time a score board will appear to announce
the winner.
